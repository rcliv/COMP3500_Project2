1. sp 16 bit? 
2. the LAMEbus
3. splhigh sets spl to the highest value, disabling all interrupts. spl0 sets spl to 0, enabling all interupts
4. because we are using 32 bit unsigned integers not just 32 bit signed integers
5. returns the old spl level
6. 15 mips/include/spl.h
7. if OPT_SYNCHPROBS then 10000 harclocks per second else 100 hardclocks per second goes off HZ times per second
8. dev/generic/console.c 
    1. con_open
    2. con_close
    3. con_io
    4. con_ioctl

    6. PART !
    7. the device struct has functions include/dev.h
        1. d_open
        2. d_close
        3. d_io
        4. d_ioctl
        5. this is the struct that a device has to be a part of

18. yes, because the thread initializer doesn’t mention any dependencies on the scheduler in its comment or in its code, and the scheduler initializer doesn’t mention any dependencies on the thread. in fact if there are no threads when the scheduler is initialized then it will call cpu_idle until something’s ready
19. kern/thread/thread.c

    1. “The name of a device is always just ‘device:’. The VFS layer puts in the device name for us, so we don’t need to do anything further.”
    2. from kern/fs/vfs/vfslist.c “device name must always be a valid string” e.g. “1hg0”
22. kern/fs/vfs/vfslist.c
    1. just the name of the device with raw appended
